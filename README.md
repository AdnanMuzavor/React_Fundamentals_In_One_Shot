## React tutorials

### Introduction:

- React is used for making **single page applications**
- Using react it is possible to render the same page with changed components without **re-loading**.
- This can reduce load on server as it doesnt has to send the page specific data again and again.

### Installation:

- **npm install -g create-react-app** : This is like buying react permanently for your system.
- **npx create-react-app appname**: This is like youâ€™re getting react for rent, using and returning it.
  - Here you're are not installing recat , still able to use it.
  - Just like you dont buy house but you stay in it for rent.
  - Another major advantage of npx is the ability to execute a package which wasn't previously installed.
  - Here package is react package.

## Fundamentals

### 1) JSX: JavaScript XML

- The code that we write in react is JSX
- This Code bedore being rendered in form of web page is compile bt **babel** compiler.
- It does so using **React.createElement(element)**

---

### 2) export Default Component_Name vs export {comp1,comp2,comp3}

- Incase of export Default Component name I can import component using any name from the file compoent has been exported
- Incase of second option While importing I have to apply structuring and call components by same name otherwise error will be thrown

---

file1.js
export Default Home;

file2.js
var a="Hello"
var b="World"

file3.js
import Home from 'file.js' => RIGHT
import HomeComp from 'file.js' => RIGHT
import comp1 from 'file2.js' => WRONG as it's not defualt exported: => SOLN => import {comp1} from "file2.js"
import {comp1,comp2,comp3} from 'file2.js'

### 3) Boostrap in React.js

- There are two ways to get BS in your app
- 1. Copy paste the BS CSS & JS links from website
- 2. Install the bootstrap using **npm i bootstrap@5.1.0** and import it in **app.js** as : **import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'**
- Note: Incase of second, for JS you have to import necessary links from via **link** tag in **index.html** for js to work.

---

### 4) props && propTypes \*\* c

- **props**
- Are properties that belong to component.
- for exmaple if I am rendering folwing component say:

---

<Navbar title="React-app" pages="5" />
______________________________________________________

- title, pages here are **props** of component **Navbar** and can be accessed as

---

const Navbar=(props)=>{
return (
<>

<h1>{props.title}</h1>
<p>Pages avaibale are: {props.pages}</p>
<>
)
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### React Hooks

## useState

- This hook is used for handing state in react.
- The systax is as follows

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## const [text,setText]=useState("Hello")

**text** -> variable used for accessing the value of state
**setText** -> Is used to change the value of state which is referneced using text variable

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## useEffect

- This hook is call back function called when page is reloaded or state mentione in call back criteria changes
- The systax is as follows:


## useEffect(function,dependency)

## Examples:

//This useeffect is call on every render
useEffect(() => {
setcount(8);
});

//This useeffect will be called as soon a spage reloads/loads for first time
useEffect(() => {
setcount(8);
}, []);

//This useeffect will be called as soon as the state in [ changes ]
useEffect(() => {
console.log("The count has been changed")
}, [count]);

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## React Context

- React Context is a way to manage state globally.
- It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.
- If this was not there qe would haqve to use prop driling where in prop state would ahve to be paased as prop to other component.
- In our mini app we have made user login with his name and that name has been set to NavBar component to display.
- Simplest way: Wrap the entire app in an ContextProvider, so whatever state it has can be accessed by all components using useContext Hook

React state has components + state
consider following

---

                      App.js
                       |                                    _________________
                       |                                    | Context login |
       --------------------------------------------         | CreateContext |
       |                      |                   |         -----------------
     SHOP                    Blogs               Offers                    |
       |                                          |                        |
--------------                                ----------                   |
   |       |                                   |      |         UseContext(login)
Clothing Food                                 O1      O2-----------|

 Login here we have login state which is true at O2 then accesing it at SHOP will be very complicated task

---

SOLN: **L I F T __**__ T H E __** S T A T E

- i.e we keep the entire state in app.js so that all components can access it
- But in that case we have to do prop drilling from App.js to respective component say o1
- Hnec e login=true will go from App.js -> Offers -> O2 while offers still has nothing to do with it.

VALID SOLN: Create a context and use context API

- Context is out side of app.js and can be used by any component there in. it's isolated from component
  hierarchy as shown above

Example: Look at the code

## useReducer

- This hook is to be used when we want to handle larger number of states together stored at single place.
- It takes in reducer function and initial state as i/p and returns
- dispatch and state as output,where state is state that has been updated and dispatch is used to trigger reducer for a particular
  action and can cause change in state
  Example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
import { useReducer } from "react";

//Define initial state
const initialState = {
count: 0,
Operation: "Nill",
};

//Define the reducer
const reducer = (state, action) => {
console.log(action);
console.log(state);
switch (action.type) {
case "INCREMENT":
return { count: state.count + 1, Operation: action.type };

    case "DECREMENT":
      return { count: state.count - 1, Operation: action.type };

    default:
      break;

}
};

const UseReducerDemo = () => {
//reducer is pure function whcih talkes state and action as input and based on action i.e requested it updates the state
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

//it returns the updated state and dispatch function whcih is used to dispatch an action

return (
<>

<div className="container">
<h2>{state.count}</h2>
<button
className="btn-primary mx-2 my-2"
onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })} >
Increment
</button>
<button
className="btn-primary mx-2 my-2"
onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })} >
Decrement
</button>
</div>
</>
);
};

export default UseReducerDemo; 
----------------------------------------------------------------------


## useLocation

- This hook help us to find out where the user is in the websiyte like on which poge and accoridingly we can act
  respond to the user to satisfy his needs
- This hooks basically gives us the current URL
- NOTE: useLocation hook is provided by **react-router-dom**
- uselocation offers follwing two important things
- **pathname**: path where we current are
- **search** : the serahc string that we have used
- example **_http://localhost:3000/useLocationHook2/userprofile?name=Adnan&email=12@gmail.com&qty=10_**
- path is: useLocationHook2/userprofile
- search is: ?name=Adnan&email=12@gmail.com&qty=10

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## useHistory

- It keep track of your page history and help you to visit the pages you were on before.
- Syntax: **const history=useHistory()**
- Important functions
- **history.goback()**: Takes to prev page visited.
- **history.push("/path")** : Take to path specified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## useParams

- it is used to exytract param passed in url for example **locahost/user:123**
- here the 123 is param while it's name is specified in **Route** tag as follows
- <Route path="/user:id" render=(()=><User />)></Route>
- hence here params= {id: 123}
- It can get access through:
- **const {id}=useParams();**
