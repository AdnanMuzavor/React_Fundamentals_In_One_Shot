- **npx create-react-app appname**: This is like youâ€™re getting react for rent, using and returning it.
  - Here you're are not installing recat , still able to use it.
  - Just like you dont buy house but you stay in it for rent.
  - Another major advantage of npx is the ability to execute a package which wasn't previously installed.
